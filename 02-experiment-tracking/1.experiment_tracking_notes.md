1. Install mlflow. I added them into requirement.txt file and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run following code after activating the virtual environment in the directory you work.
```
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

3. In case of error check running processes:
```
lsof -i :5000
lsof | grep mlflow.db
kill -9 <PID>
```

4. Logging models in MLflow
  - `ml_flow.log_artifact('mymodel', artifact_path='models/')`
  - `ml_flow.<framework>.log_model(model, artifact_path='models/')`

5. [Model Registry](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#migrating-from-stages)
- To make sure which models are ready to prod, can be archieved etc. 
- Once they're registered, deployment engineers can move the models to related environments.

6. To run the code from terminal: eg. `python hpo.py`
